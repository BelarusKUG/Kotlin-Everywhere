## Event Description

_Here is where you should put basic information about your conference itself. Where is it? When? What's your conference salespitch? Please make this as informative as you can. Make sure to include things like the dates and location of your conference. The more you can tell prospective speakers the better. If they have to go hunting for this type of information, you run the risk of losing them._

## The Quick Version

Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference _without a refund_ at the discretion of the conference organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.

```
We are doing our best to reimburse flight and accommodation. However our ability is limited. So, if you feel that free conference ticket is enough to join us as a speaker, or do you have company that can cover your travel expenses, please let us know. We will for sure have to manage carefully expenses, so any help from your side will be greatly appreciated. At the same time we will do our best to reimburse as many speakers’ expenses as possible. Please let us know which statement below applies to you: 

* I need flight and/or accommodation reimbursement 
* It would be great to have flight and/or accommodation reimbursement, but I will come on my own if needed 
* I will fly on my own or my company will cover flight. Free conference ticket is enough for me.
